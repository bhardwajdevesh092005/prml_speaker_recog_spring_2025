# Meeting #3 - Minutes of Meeting

**Date:** 23 March  
**Time:** 10 PM  
**Venue:** Tinkering Lab  
**Attendees:** B23EE1020, B23EE1037, B23EE1015, B23CS1014, B23CS1017, B23EE1080  

## Discussion Points

### 1. Progress Updates

#### **Frontend & Backend (B23EE1037 & B23CS1014)**
- API endpoints finalized.
- Basic backend structure implemented; integration with model pending.
- UI enhancements based on feedback.

#### **Audio Processing & Feature Extraction (B23EE1020 & B23EE1015)**
- Implemented feature extraction using Torchaudio.
- Extracted MFCC, spectral features, and other relevant parameters.
- Verified extracted features on sample audio recordings.

#### **Model Implementation & Testing (B23CS1017 & B23EE1080)**
- Evaluated KNN, Bayesian Classifier, and Decision Trees on real voice samples.
- Decision Trees performed the best, but further testing is needed.
- Started experimenting with SVM and Neural Networks for better accuracy.

### 2. Key Decisions & Next Steps
- Feature Extraction completed using Torchaudio.
- Finalizing model by comparing Decision Trees, SVM, and Neural Networks.
- Integration of the finalized model with the backend.
- Web app testing with real-time voice inputs.

## Action Items for Next Meeting

- **B23EE1037 & B23CS1014:** Begin backend-model integration and refine UI.
- **B23EE1020 & B23EE1015:** Document the feature extraction pipeline.
- **B23CS1017 & B23EE1080:** Finalize the best model and optimize for real-time use.
