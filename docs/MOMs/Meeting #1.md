**Date:** 6 March 2025  
**Time:** 10:00 PM  
**Venue:** Tinkering Lab

## Discussion Points  

### Broad Project Idea  
The project focuses on **Speaker Recognition**â€”identifying who is speaking from audio data. We will use traditional approaches such as **KNN, Bayesian Classifier, and Decision Trees**.  

Our next main task is **feature extraction** from the given `.wav` audio dataset.  
In addition to using a Kaggle dataset, we plan to train and test the model using our **own voice samples**.  

The project will conclude with a **web app** that performs real-time speaker recognition.  

### Task Allocation  
- **B23EE1037 & B23CS1014**:  
  - Work on **frontend and backend development**, including designing the **UI**.  
  - Assist in **feature engineering**.  

- **B23EE1020 & B23EE1015**:  
  - Process own sample audios, convert them to **.wav format**, and apply **noise cancellation** techniques.  
  - Compile **project documentation**, including writing the **introduction and methodology** for the report.  

- **B23CS1017 & B23EE1080**:  
  - Implement and compare **different machine learning models** for speaker recognition.  
  - Tune hyperparameters and **select the best model**.  

## Action Items  
- Each team member will complete their assigned task and report progress in the next meeting.  
- **Noise cancellation** and **model selection** will be tested on sample recordings before finalizing the approach.  
- **Integration of the model with the frontend** will begin after initial model testing.
